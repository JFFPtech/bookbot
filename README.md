# BookBot Project

The BookBot is a simple Python script designed to analyze the text of a book. It can read the book text from a file, count the number of words, and create a frequency dictionary of all characters in the text.

## Features

- **Read Book Text**: Load and read the contents of a text file.
- **Count Words**: Calculate the total number of words in the book.
- **Character Frequency Analysis**: Generate a dictionary that maps each character to its frequency of appearance in the text.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python installed on your system. This code has been tested with Python 3.8, but it should work with any Python 3.x version.

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookbot.git
```

Usage

To run the BookBot, navigate to the project directory and run:

```
python main.py
```

Make sure that the books directory contains a text file named frankenstein.txt, as the script expects this file by default.
